## Project Summary and Vision

Facebook Marketplace is a popular platform for buying and selling items; however, its public nature can expose students—especially those with little to no experience—to scams and unsafe transactions.

MarketSafe aims to reduce these risks by providing a **private marketplace accessible only to students at the University of Manitoba, with transactions restricted to meetups within or near the university area**. The goal is to create a safer environment where students can confidently buy and sell items within their own community.

There are two main user groups on MarketSafe: student sellers and student buyers. By limiting access to verified students and localizing transactions to the university area, we believe the platform can significantly reduce the likelihood of unsafe or fraudulent transactions.
